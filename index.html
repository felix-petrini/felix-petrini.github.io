                This is an HTML / CSS / JS workspace that I will update as time goes on. I will not change any previous code iterations so you can see my progress through web dev as time goes on. Below is a helpful list of links that I will update that can take you to each edit.

                My name is Felix Petrini. I am an avid CS student in the ninth grade. When I am a senior, I hope to go to an Ivy League college and get a PhD in Computer Engineering.
