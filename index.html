                This is an HTML / CSS / JS workspace that I will update as time goes on. I will not change any previous code iterations so you can see my progress through web dev as time goes on. Below is a helpful list of links that I will update that can take you to each edit.

        <div id="iteration2">
            <h2>Iteration 2</h2>
            <p>This is iteration 2 of my website. I have learned substantial things like <strong>bold</strong>, <i>italics</i>, <u>underlining</u>, and <span style="color: red;">c</span><span style="color: orange;">o</span><span style="color: yellow;">l</span><span style="color: green;">o</span><span style="color: blue;">r</span><span style="color:purple;">s</span>! Next, I hope to work on a background / background image because this white is getting pretty bland.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="iteration3">
            <h2>Iteration 3</h2>
            <p>This is iteration 3 of my website. I learned how to do a background color as you can see, and I learned how to use classes instead of ids so I have that. You can't really see it, but that means I can group multiple divs together! I also learned how to make a button which is below if you want to click it.</p>
            <button type="button">Click me!</button>
            <p>As you can see, it doesn't really do much yet, but I want to change that in my next iteration. JavaScript, here I come!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="iteration4">
            <p>This is iteration 4 of my website. Below is another button with (hopefully) a little surprise.</p>
            <button type="button" onclick="confetti()">Click me!</button>
            <canvas id="it4button" width="400" height="400" style="border: 1px solid white">Cannot create surprise window</canvas>

            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>
                My name is Felix Petrini. I am an avid CS student in the ninth grade. When I am a senior, I hope to go to an Ivy League college and get a PhD in Computer Engineering.
